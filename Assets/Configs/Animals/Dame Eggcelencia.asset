  animalDescription: "Oh, child\u2026 I\u2019m Dame Eggcelencia. I\u2019ve seen nests
    built and nests broken. Ask, and I\u2019ll tell you what life has taught me \u2014
    whether you like it or not."
  animalAdvice:
  - 'If it feels wrong, it probably is. '
  - "Yes \u2014 but only if you keep both eyes open. "
  - "Don\u2019t rush. Good things take time. "
  - You already know the answer
  - "No, sugar. That\u2019s a mess waiting to happen. "
  - Listen before you leap.
  - 'Yes, but mind your manners. '
  - "You\u2019re chasing feathers in the wind."
  - "It\u2019s not the time \u2014 yet. "
  - 'Trust is earned, not expected. '
  - "You\u2019ll be fine \u2014 just don\u2019t forget your coat. "
  - "That idea\u2019s half-baked. Let it sit. "
  - Go ahead. Just be kind while doing it.
  - "Life\u2019s messy. Do it anyway."
  - "Don\u2019t say yes just to be nice."
  - 'A no today can be a yes tomorrow. '
  - "Don\u2019t fight the current \u2014 float, then steer. "
  - "Yes \u2014 but call your mother first."
  - "No need to hurry. You\u2019ve got time."
  - 'Life is eggshells and sunshine. Step carefully. '
