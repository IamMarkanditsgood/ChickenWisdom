  animalDescription: "Darling, I\u2019m Zazoo \u2014 fabulously flawed and perfectly
    pink. I don\u2019t predict your future. I reveal your sparkle. Ready to see yourself
    clearly?"
  animalAdvice:
  - "You shine \u2014 even if you don\u2019t see it yet. "
  - "No, they\u2019re not better than you. "
  - 'Darling, own your weird. '
  - "Yes! And you don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission. "
  - 'Stop comparing your feathers to theirs. '
  - "Mmm\u2026 not today. Rest and slay tomorrow."
  - "Be you \u2014 loudly. "
  - "That voice in your head? It\u2019s wrong. "
  - "You\u2019re enough. Always were. "
  - "Confidence, please \u2014 shoulders back, beak high!"
  - "Nope. You\u2019re overthinking again. "
  - 'Someone wishes they had your sparkle. '
  - "Yes \u2014 if you stop hiding your fabulousness"
  - Beauty is boring. Be interesting.
  - "Don\u2019t shrink. Take up space."
  - Apologize less. Dance more.
  - 'No need to fix what was never broken. '
  - "You\u2019re not too much. They\u2019re too bland. "
  - Yes! Now go strut your truth.
  - "No. Not because you can\u2019t \u2014 because you shouldn\u2019t have to."
